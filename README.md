# PDDL Planning for Book Reading Schedule 📚
## Developed by Joan Bennàssar Martín, Joan Bernaus Casadesús, and Jaume Mora i Ladària

### Overview 📖
This project explores the application of PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) in solving a complex problem of planning a year-long reading schedule under various constraints. The project was designed as part of the Basic Algorithms for Artificial Intelligence course, focusing on familiarizing with PDDL and problem-solving in AI.

### Features 🛠️
- **Domain Modeling**: Multiple domain extensions to handle different constraints like book prerequisites and parallel readings.
- **Complex Constraints Handling**: Ensuring some books are read before others, and some within close temporal proximity.
- **Automated Problem Instances**: Use of Python scripts to generate random problem instances for testing.

### Execution 🚀
1. Ensure a PDDL planner like Fast Downward is installed and configured.
2. Run the problem instances using the provided domain and problem definition files.
3. Analyze the planner's output to understand the planned schedule.

### Project Structure 🗂️
- **Domain Files**: Define the rules and constraints for the planning environment.
- **Problem Files**: Specific instances of the reading schedule problem.
- **Python Scripts**: For generating random problem instances and testing.

### Conclusions 📝
The application of PDDL in this project demonstrates its robustness in handling real-world planning problems, particularly in educational contexts where understanding complex dependencies is crucial.
